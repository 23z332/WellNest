            <h2>Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005</h2>
            <p>The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA) is a significant law enacted to provide protection to women from domestic violence in India. It covers not just physical violence but also emotional, verbal, sexual, and economic abuse, along with threats and harassment. The Act applies to women in domestic relationships, including wives, mothers, daughters, sisters, and female live-in partners, recognizing relationships in the nature of marriage as well. It provides for various remedies such as protection orders to stop abuse, residence orders to ensure the woman's right to live in the shared household, monetary relief for maintenance and medical expenses, custody orders for children, and compensation for damages or mental trauma. A woman can file a complaint through a Protection Officer, the police, or directly approach a Magistrate. The Act also ensures that legal aid is available and mandates the Magistrate to dispose of cases typically within 60 days. Being a civil law, it allows for faster and more accessible justice without necessarily involving criminal charges, offering a strong framework for the safety and dignity of women in their homes.</p>

            <h2>Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013</h2>
            <p>The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 was enacted to ensure a safe and secure working environment for women by addressing and preventing acts of sexual harassment at the workplace. The law defines sexual harassment broadly to include physical contact, demands for sexual favors, making sexually colored remarks, showing pornography, and any unwelcome physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature. It applies to all workplaces—government or private, organized or unorganized sectors—and includes domestic workers, interns, and women visiting workplaces. Under the Act, every organization with 10 or more employees is required to form an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to receive and redress complaints of sexual harassment in a time-bound manner. In places with fewer than 10 employees, a Local Complaints Committee (LCC) is established by the District Officer. The law also prescribes procedures for inquiry, timelines for resolution (usually within 90 days), and penalties for false complaints as well as for non-compliance by employers. This Act empowers women to speak up against harassment and ensures accountability within institutions, promoting respect, equality, and safety in the professional sphere.

            <h2>Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961</h2>
            <p>The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was enacted to prevent the giving and taking of dowry in India, aiming to curb the social evil that often leads to harassment, abuse, and even deaths of women. Under this Act, “dowry” refers to any property, goods, or valuable security given or agreed to be given directly or indirectly by one party to a marriage to the other, or by the parents or relatives of either party, before, during, or after the marriage. The Act makes the giving, taking, or demanding of dowry a punishable offense with imprisonment of at least five years and a fine of ₹15,000 or the value of the dowry, whichever is more. It also mandates that any dowry received must be transferred to the bride within a prescribed time. The Act empowers both the bride and her family to report dowry demands or harassment due to dowry, and includes provisions for protecting women from cruelty related to dowry under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. Although enforcement remains a challenge, the law represents a strong legal foundation for addressing dowry-related issues and promoting gender equality in marriages.</p>

            <h2>The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961</h2>
            <p>The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 is a legislation aimed at regulating the employment of women during the period of maternity and providing them with certain benefits to ensure their health and the health of their child. It applies to establishments employing 10 or more people and grants female employees the right to paid maternity leave, nursing breaks, and protection from dismissal during maternity leave. As per the 2017 amendment, eligible women are entitled to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave for the first two children, and 12 weeks for subsequent children. The Act also provides for maternity leave in case of miscarriage, tubectomy operation, or adoption (12 weeks for adopting mothers of a child below three months). It prohibits employers from assigning arduous work to pregnant women and ensures their right to return to work after maternity leave. This legislation plays a critical role in promoting the welfare of working women, ensuring job security, and supporting work-life balance for mothers.

            <h2>The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006</h2>
            <p>The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, was enacted by the Government of India to prevent child marriages and safeguard the rights of children, particularly girls, in the country. The Act defines a child as anyone under the age of 18 for females and under the age of 21 for males. It aims to curb the practice of child marriage, which often leads to early pregnancies, health complications, and social exclusion for young girls, as well as denying them opportunities for education and personal growth. The Act prohibits the solemnization of child marriages and declares them illegal, though it does not annul the marriage outright. If a child marriage occurs, the Act provides for legal measures, including penalties for those who perform, promote, or assist in such marriages. It also includes provisions for the protection and rehabilitation of children affected by child marriages, providing for the possibility of the marriage being declared void by the court upon the application of the minor, the guardian, or another concerned party. Furthermore, the Act directs the appointment of Child Marriage Prohibition Officers at the district level to enforce its provisions. Despite this legislation, child marriage remains a challenge in India, particularly in rural areas, where traditional practices and social norms often perpetuate the problem. The Act is a step toward promoting gender equality, education, and empowerment for young girls, contributing to a broader effort to improve child welfare and reduce early-age marriages.</p>

            <h2>The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986</h2>
            <p>The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986, is a legislation enacted by the Government of India to prevent the indecent portrayal of women in media, advertisements, and publications. The primary objective of the Act is to curb the exploitation and objectification of women by prohibiting the representation of women in ways that are obscene, vulgar, or offensive, thereby ensuring their dignity and respect in society. Under the provisions of the Act, any form of representation that depicts women in a derogatory or indecent manner is banned, including through images, videos, or writings in print and electronic media.

              The Act defines "indecent representation" as the depiction of women in a manner that is vulgar, obscene, or otherwise likely to incite or encourage sexual exploitation or abuse. It also makes it illegal to publish or display such representations, and it empowers the government to take legal action against those involved in such representations, including penalties and imprisonment. The Act provides for the establishment of a regulatory body, which may include the prohibition of any material that violates its provisions.
              
              Additionally, the Act includes a provision for the confiscation of material that violates its terms, and offenders can face a fine or imprisonment, or both. The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986, serves as an important legal tool in the broader effort to promote gender equality, protect women's rights, and challenge the societal norms that contribute to the exploitation of women in various forms of media. Despite this legislation, concerns continue to arise about the portrayal of women in some modern media, and ongoing efforts are necessary to address these issues.</p>

            <h2>The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976</h2>
            <p>The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, is an important legislation in India that aims to eliminate gender-based wage discrimination and ensure equal pay for equal work. The Act mandates that both men and women receive equal remuneration for performing the same or similar work, without any discrimination based on gender. Its primary objective is to address the gender wage gap and ensure that women are not paid less than men for work of equal value.

              The Act applies to all establishments, including government offices, private organizations, and industrial sectors, and covers both skilled and unskilled labor. According to the provisions of the Act, employers are prohibited from paying women employees less than their male counterparts for the same work or for work that is of equal value. The Act also directs the government to appoint inspectors to ensure compliance with the law and empowers them to investigate cases of wage discrimination.
              
              In addition to ensuring equal pay, the Act also provides for the creation of rules and regulations to further safeguard the interests of women workers. This includes provisions for the prohibition of discrimination in the recruitment process, in terms of wages, allowances, and other employment benefits.
              
              If any violation occurs, the Act stipulates penalties, including fines and possible imprisonment for employers who fail to comply with the law. The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, plays a critical role in promoting gender equality in the workplace by challenging the prevalent societal norms that often undervalue women's contributions to work and ensure they receive fair compensation for their labor. Despite the Act's provisions, challenges remain in achieving full implementation, particularly in sectors with entrenched gender biases.</p>

            <h2>The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971</h2>
            <p>The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, is a landmark piece of legislation in India that allows women to legally terminate a pregnancy under certain conditions. The Act was enacted with the aim of providing safe and legal options for abortion, reducing the risk of unsafe, illegal abortions, and protecting women's health and rights. It recognizes a woman's right to make decisions regarding her own body, particularly when the pregnancy poses a threat to her physical or mental health, or in cases of fetal abnormalities.

              The Act permits the termination of pregnancy under the following circumstances:
              
              Risk to the woman's physical or mental health: If continuing the pregnancy would endanger the woman's life or cause serious physical or mental harm.
              
              Fetal abnormalities: If there is a significant risk that the child would be born with serious physical or mental abnormalities that would cause lifelong suffering.
              
              Pregnancy resulting from rape or incest: In such cases, abortion can be carried out to protect the woman from mental trauma.
              
              The MTP Act allows abortion to be performed by a medical practitioner in a licensed healthcare facility. Initially, the Act allowed abortions only up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, but a major amendment in 2021 extended this limit for certain categories, including cases of fetal abnormalities, to 24 weeks, especially for special categories of women like minors, survivors of sexual assault, and those with physical disabilities.
